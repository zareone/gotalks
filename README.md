# Go talks 

Here you can find the slides of a introductory talk I gave in the first *Golang Barcelona Meetup*. 

I'll be hosting them somewhere as soon as I can (they need Go Present tool in order to work).

Meanwhile, you can clone the repo and serve them from your machine. It's really easy!


## Installation

1. [Install Go](http://golang.org/doc/install) for your platform if needed.

2. Install the *Present* tool: 

```bash
$ go get golang.org/x/tools/present
```

3. Clone this repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zareone/gotalks.git
```

4. Run the Present tool in the repo folder

```bash
$ cd gotalks
$ present
```

5. Open your browser to the IP/port specified by the Present tool (most likely [http://127.0.0.1:3999](http://127.0.0.1:3999))
